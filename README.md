# Machinery Diagnostic Assistant with GenAI

<img src="Image.png" alt="Description" width="600"/>


This project was developed for the [5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/5-day-genai), showcasing how Generative AI can enhance predictive maintenance for rotating equipment. Read more about it in my [Medium post](https://medium.com/@ali.dibaj93/machinery-diagnostic-assistant-enhancing-predictive-maintenance-with-genai-547ca9eddf8a).


# GenAI Capabilities Demonstrated
- **Function Calling**: Getting Gemini to trigger analysis functions when someone asks about equipment
- **Few-Shot Learning**: Showing Gemini some examples so it knows how to interpret fault data
- **Structured Output**: Getting consistent, JSON-formatted reports instead of random text

# What's Next
- Integration with real sensors and IoT systems
- Expanded fault detection capabilities
- Equipment history incorporation
- Mobile interface development
